## Values

IDaaS is an abbreviation of Identity As a Service. Contains all functions of traditional IAM and can bring more benefits to companies: enhance marketing and operational efficiency; Accelerate new business online; enhance safety to reduce network attack risks; enhance user experience.

### Operation capacity

The traditional IAM account center has weak operational capabilities, difficult to meet large organizations in business, while IDaaS's multi-tenant operation platform and automation workflow (Workflow) can easily enhance corporate operation efficiency.

### Advocacy and scalability

When the number of users continues to rise, the pressure on the user system will continue to increase. The IDaaS of origin cloud can solve this problem, using the Authing IDaaS as an example, with nearly 10 million users per month logging into thousands of systems, with large-scale data processing experience, the digital identity solution built can better support enterprise expansion.
